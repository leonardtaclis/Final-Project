As for its historical milestone, the said tourist spot was a former rest and recreation facility of Gi Joe soldiers. Through the years, much have been said about; and it had undergone several renovations.   To name a few, it was lavishly converted into a privately-owned resort. Personally, the private developers of Camp John Hay had opted to eradicate the favorite landmarks and tourists haunts of the olden days in and around Camp John Hay.  Magnificently, they were replaced by modernized architectural structures like for instance, the “Old World Main Club”. Despite of all these architectural makeovers,  it is still a distinctively world-class tourist attraction of Baguio City.</p></td>
